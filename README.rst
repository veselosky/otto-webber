Otto Webber - Manage a remote web server
========================================
Otto Webber is my server management assistant. He helps me configure and monitor servers.

.. warning::

    This software is **not** ready for real use. In fact, it hardly does anything
    at all. At the moment it is just a scratch pad for some automation scripts,
    because I am too lazy to learn chef or puppet. There are more TODOs than lines
    of code, and even when it works, it will probably only work for me.
    You should use something else.
